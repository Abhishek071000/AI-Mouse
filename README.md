# AI-Mouse
The mouse is one of the wonderful inventions of Human-Computer Interaction (HCI) technology. Currently, wireless mouse or a Bluetooth mouse still uses devices and is not 
free of devices completely since it uses a battery for power and a dongle to connect it to the PC. In the proposed AI virtual mouse system, this limitation can be overcome by employing webcam or a built-in camera for capturing of hand gestures and hand tip detection using computer vision. The algorithm used in the system makes use of the machine learning algorithm. 

Based on the hand gestures, the computer can be controlled virtually and can perform left click, right click, scrolling functions, and computer cursor function without the use of the physical mouse. The algorithm is based on deep learning for detecting the hands. Hence, the proposed system will avoid dependency of devices to control the computer.

The Camera Used in the AI Virtual Mouse System
The proposed AI virtual mouse system is based on the frames that have been captured by the webcam in a laptop or PC. By using the Python computer vision library OpenCV, 
the video capture object is created and the web camera will start capturing video, as shown in Figure 4. The web camera captures and passes the frames to the AI virtual 
system.
